## Accelerators
**Founders Talent Accelerator**                
Dublin, Ireland - Jan 2025 - Apr 2025

● [Participated](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0131/1493943-founders-programme/) in a Talent Accelerator to find co-founders and create a startup. Explored areas in AI For SportsTech,
Agentic Workflows for Task Mining, ML based Insights Platform for Longitudinal Gut Microbiome Analysis.

## Side Projects

### Content Creation
1. Actively post about AI developments, libraries and papers on LinkedIn. Grew to 13k+ followers. Checkout some of my best posts on my profile [page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramodith/).

2. Blog about my projects and ideas on [Medium](https://medium.com/@buildingblocks).

### AI Agents
**[MCP Server to Order Coffee](https://github.com/pramodith/DevTerminalShopMCPServer)**
Explored how to create custom MCP servers by playing around with DevTerminalShop which lets users order coffee using an API or the terminal.

**[Agent-to-Agent Protocol Demo](https://github.com/pramodith/DevTerminalShopMCPServer)**
Show cased the different features/functionalities of the A2A protocol proposed by Google to standardize the communication with agents hosted anywhere.
* Showed how model cards work and where they are hosted.
* Highlighted how clients can subscribe to the updates of an Agent.

**[Gut Microbiome Research Bot](https://github.com/pramodith/inni/blob/master/src/biomedical_agent.py)**
Explored SmolAgents and created an Agent that uses Pubmed/Biorxiv to identify research papers and answer questions that help a practitioner keep up-to date with the world of Gut Microbiome research.

**[Company Reasearch Assistant](https://github.com/pramodith/CompanyResearchAssistant)**
Explored LangGraph andd created an agent that automates the process of crawling company websites, extracting product and service information, classifying the company, and generating reports—including Google Docs—using AI and various integrations.

### AI Modeling and Training
**[Create your own GRPO Trainer](https://pramodith.github.io/posts/grpo-trainer/)** A tutorial to implement your own GRPO Training Loop without using veRL, TRL etc. Also goes into the weeds of the math behind the GRPO objective.

**[Benchmarking SOTA LLMs on Medical Definition Recognition](https://github.com/pramodith/definition_understanding)**

**[Mechanistic Interpretability and Superposition 101](https://pramodith.github.io/posts/superposition/)** A 101 on how deep learning models can learn more features than dimensions through the concept of superposition.

**[Exploring Sink Tokens](https://github.com/pramodith/llm_exploration/tree/main)**  
Researched how Transformer models (encoder and decoder) consistently direct attention to a small set of "sink" tokens like [CLS] or the first token. Found that dense self-attention may be unnecessary, suggesting more efficient LLM training strategies.  
- Wrote [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@buildingblocks/llms-may-not-need-dense-self-attention-1fa3bf47522e) summarizing findings and experiments.

**[Liger-Kernels Contributions](https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel)**  
Open-source contributions to RLHF kernel functions, including SimPO and CPO. Also wrote Triton kernels (e.g., GroupNorm) to accelerate training.  

**[Klarity Contributions](https://github.com/klara-research/klarity)**  
Benchmaked how hallucinations can be detected using entropy metrics. Enforced structured outputs in JudgeLLMs and optimized static embeddings to stabilize token similarity results.

**[SemEval 2020 — Humor Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.134/)**  
Finished Top 5 in Task 7 of SemEval 2020. Built Siamese Transformer models to assess the funniness of edited news headlines.  
- Published paper: *LMML at SemEval-2020 Task 7*

**[Block Stacking with RL](https://tanmaybinaykiya.github.io/YODO-Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning/)**  
Designed a 2D block stacking environment using Q-learning. Studied the influence of oracles and demonstrations on suboptimal Q-tables.
